# THE-AAAI-CONFERENCE-ON-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
 
Papers of 2022 THE-AAAI-CONFERENCE-ON-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE  are all here.

You can download them by download this project in github.

Or you can download them in Official website of AAAI "https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-22/"  by my python code.

The file "spder.ipynb" is the python script(open with "Jupyter")  to download the papers ,only two "PluGeN MultiLabel Conditional Generation From PreTrained Models"  and  "On the Impossibility of NonTrivial Accuracy in Presence of Fairness Constraints" can't download by this script.

So I download them manually.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
